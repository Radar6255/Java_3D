# 3D_Testing

This is an old project where I was creating a 3D java engine from scratch without many 3D classes. To use either open in Eclipse IDE or download and run the executable jar file(Also requires JOCL dll file in same directory), the controls are wasd and space bar. Escape allows you to close the game and access settings.

Recommended to have computer with more than 3 threads to run smoothly, GPU is used now. Settings menu can reduce the number of threads used and if OpenCL is used (generally slower).

I have stopped work on this project mostly due to the reason I was trying to find the positions of the cube faces on the CPU which is slow and I didn't use OpenGL until the end.
