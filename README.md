# 3D_Testing
This is a project where I am creating a 3D java engine from scratch without many 3D classes, because why not. To use either open in Eclipse IDE or download and run the executable jar file, the controls are wasd and space bar. Escape allows you to close the game. This is esssentially a CPU bench test so a CPU with 3 or more threads is recommended for optimal performance.
