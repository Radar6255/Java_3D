# 3D_Testing
This is a project where I am creating a 3D java engine from scratch without many 3D classes, because why not. To use either open in Eclipse IDE or download and run the executable jar file(Also requires JOCL dll file in same directory), the controls are wasd and space bar. Escape allows you to close the game and access settings.

Recommended to have computer with more than 3 threads to run smoothly, GPU is used a little. Settings menu can reduce the number of threads used and if the GPU is used at all.
